# Overview #

Models for the seamonkey db, they are written using ROM (Ruby Object Mapper)[http://www.rom-rb.org].


## TODO ##

Man there is a lot to do here, don't look yet, using experimental rom-rb code

* Setup mysql dataobjects to work
* package as a private github gem
* test the models against the db liquidbase schema
* other stuff i can't think of
